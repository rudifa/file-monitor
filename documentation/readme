WHAT IS FILE MONITOR?
=========================

File Monitor is a cross-platform viewer that displays files and
automatically redraws them when they are changed on disk.  This
makes File Monitor a perfect logfile viewer, or a nice canvas upon
which to display changing image files.  If you are editing SVG files
or HTML files programatically or by hand, File Monitor provides a
real-time window into the results of each of your changes.

To begin using File Monitor, either drag a file onto File Monitor
or click the load file button.  File Monitor allows you to zoom
into and navigate files of interest.  Whenever a file is reloaded
or closed and opened, all navigation settings are restored.

File Monitor supports the display of text, html, svg, and image
file formats.
