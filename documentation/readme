WHAT IS FILE MONITOR?
=========================

File Monitor is a cross-platform viewer that displays files and
automatically redraws them when they are changed on disk.  This
makes File Monitor a perfect logfile viewer, or a nice canvas upon
which to display changing files.  

File Monitor allows you to zoom into and otherwise navigate files of
interest. Whenever a file is reloaded or closed and opened, all
navigation settings are restored.

File Monitor supports the display of text, html, svg, and image
file formats.
